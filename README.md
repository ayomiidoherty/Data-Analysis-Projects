# SALES ANALYSIS 
# PROJECT OVERVIEW 

REC Corp needed the following questions answered: 
1) Is there any trend in the sales of all four products during certain months?
2) Out of all four products, which product has seen the highest sales in all the given years?
3) The company has all its retail centers closed every year on the 31st of December. Mr Hariharan, the CEO, would love to get an estimate on No: of units of each product that could be sold on 31st of Dec, every year if all their retail centers were kept open.
4) The CEO is considering dropping the production of any one of the products. He wants you to analyze this data and suggest whether his idea would result in a massive setback for the company.
5) The CEO would also like to predict the sales and revenues for the year 2023. He wants you to give a yearly estimate with the best possible accuracy.




# OBJECTIVE 


This project aims to evaluate the sales performance and revenue contributions of four products (P1, P2, P3, and P4) over multiple years, assess the potential impact of discontinuing a product, estimate sales performance for December 31st when their retail outlets are closed and forecast sales and revenue for the following year of 2023. 




# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 


## Sales Trends
   Sales for all four products exhibit a consistent trend across months, with P1 consistently leading in sales across all months.
## Top-Performing Product
   P1 has consistently outperformed the other products, generating the highest total sales across all years.
## December 31st Estimate
   Estimated sales for December 31st indicate P1 would generate the highest sales, followed by P3, P2, and P4.
## Product Discontinuation Impact
   Discontinuing any one product would likely result in a substantial revenue loss, with P4 being the least impactful to drop due to its lower sales contribution.






# Sales Trends

The bar chart for monthly sales shows that P1 consistently outperforms the other products in terms of units sold every month. This trend suggests that P1 holds a strong market demand and customer loyalty. 

## Seasonal Peaks in January and December

Sales across all four products (P1, P2, P3, P4) show significant increases in January and December. This indicates a potential seasonal trend, driven by holidays, promotions, or increased customer demand during these months.

# Sales Trends in Different Months

## Highest Performing Months

**July** stands out as the top-performing month for P1 and P4, with both products achieving the highest sales during this period.
On the other hand, **January** proved to be the strongest month for P2 and P3, with these products showing the highest sales in this early month of the year.

## Lowest Performing Month

**February** consistently emerged as the lowest-performing month across all four products. This suggests that there might be a seasonal dip in demand during this period, possibly due to factors like post-holiday season reductions in purchasing behavior or other external variables influencing consumer purchasing decisions.

# December 31st Sales Estimate

## Estimated Units Sold

- **P1**: 3,847 units (highest contribution)
* **P2**: 2,012 units
+ **P3**: 3,074 units
- **P4**: 1,125 units (lowest contribution)

**P1** and **P3** dominate the estimated sales for December 31st respectively. These products exhibit strong consumer demand and should remain focal points in inventory planning for peak periods.
Retail centers should consider opening on December 31st, as the estimated sales figures indicate significant revenue potential from **P1** and **P3**.

# Impact of Product Discontinuation 

## Revenue Contribution (%):
- **P1**: 25.31%
+ **P2**: 26.16%
* **P3**: 33.02%
* **P4**: 15.51%

## Sales Contribution (%):
+ **P1**: 39.18%
- **P2**: 20.25%
* **P3**: 29.90%
+ **P4**: 10.68%

P1 Makes up  **(25.31%)** of revenue and **(39.18%)** of sales, making it the flagship product. Discontinuation would result in a critical revenue loss, destabilizing the companyâ€™s sales structure.
P3 generates the highest revenue contribution **(33.02%)** and significant sales **(29.90%)**. Its discontinuation would severely reduce profitability.
While P2 contributes **(26.16%)** to revenue, its sales volume is lower **(20.25%)**
P4 contributes only **(15.51%)** of revenue and 10.68% of sales. Its discontinuation would have the least financial impact, allowing the company to reallocate resources to higher-performing products like P1 and P3. P4 should be considered for discontinuation as its contribution to both revenue and sales is significantly lower than the other products. By eliminating P4, the company can reduce costs associated with production, inventory, and marketing while focusing on its top-performing products.




# Recommendations


## 1.	Product Optimization
- Discontinue P4 due to its **low revenue and sales contribution**. This will enable the company to concentrate resources on high-performing products like P1 and P3.
+ Before discontinuation, customer feedback should be analyzed on P4 to ensure the company does not alienate a niche but loyal customer segment.
## 2.	Revenue Maximization
- Conduct a pricing analysis for P1 to explore potential price adjustments. Increasing its unit price slightly could align its revenue contribution with its sales volume dominance, boosting profitability without significant loss in demand.
+ Focus on **marketing and promotions** for P3 to sustain its position as the highest revenue generator.
## 3.	Sales Strategy for December 31st
- Open retail centers on December 31st to further maximize profitability. 
+ Consider a **clearance or discount strategy** for P4 to reduce inventory levels and generate incremental revenue before its potential discontinuation.
## 4.	Future Exploration
- Evaluate the potential of introducing a new product to replace P4, leveraging lessons learned from its underperformance.

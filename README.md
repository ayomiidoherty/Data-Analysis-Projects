# SALES ANALYSIS 
# PROJECT OVERVIEW 

REC Corp needed the following questions answered: 
1) Is there any trend in the sales of all four products during certain months?
2) Out of all four products, which product has seen the highest sales in all the given years?
3) The company has all its retail centers closed every year on the 31st of December. Mr Hariharan, the CEO, would love to get an estimate on No: of units of each product that could be sold on 31st of Dec, every year if all their retail centers were kept open.
4) The CEO is considering dropping the production of any one of the products. He wants you to analyze this data and suggest whether his idea would result in a massive setback for the company.
5) The CEO would also like to predict the sales and revenues for the year 2023. He wants you to give a yearly estimate with the best possible accuracy.




# OBJECTIVE 


This project aims to evaluate the sales performance and revenue contributions of four products (P1, P2, P3, and P4) over multiple years, assess the potential impact of discontinuing a product, estimate sales performance for December 31st when their retail outlets are closed and forecast sales and revenue for the following year of 2023. 




# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. Sales Trends: Sales for all four products exhibit a consistent trend across months, with P1 consistently leading in sales across all months.
2. Top-Performing Product: P1 has consistently outperformed the other products, generating the highest total sales across all years.
3. December 31st Estimate: Estimated sales for December 31st indicate P1 would generate the highest sales, followed by P3, P2, and P4.
4. Product Discontinuation Impact: Discontinuing any one product would likely result in a substantial revenue loss, with P4 being the least impactful to drop due to its lower sales contribution.



# Sales Trends

The bar chart for monthly sales shows that P1 consistently outperforms the other products in terms of units sold every month. This trend suggests that P1 holds a strong market demand and customer loyalty. 

Seasonal Peaks in January and December

Sales across all four products (P1, P2, P3, P4) show significant increases in January and December. This indicates a potential seasonal trend, driven by holidays, promotions, or increased customer demand during these months.

# Sales Trends in Different Months

# Highest Performing Months

July stands out as the top-performing month for P1 and P4, with both products achieving the highest sales during this period.
On the other hand, January proved to be the strongest month for P2 and P3, with these products showing the highest sales in this early month of the year.

# Lowest Performing Month

February consistently emerged as the lowest performing month across all four products. This suggests that there might be a seasonal dip in demand during this period, possibly due to factors like post-holiday season reductions in purchasing behavior or other external variables influencing consumer purchasing decisions.

# December 31st Sales Estimate

# Estimated Units Sold

P1: 3,847 units (highest contribution)
P2: 2,012 units
P3: 3,074 units
P4: 1,125 units (lowest contribution)

P1 and P3 dominate the estimated sales for December 31st respectively. These products exhibit strong consumer demand and should remain focal points in inventory planning for peak periods.
Retail centers should consider opening on December 31st, as the estimated sales figures indicate significant revenue potential from P1 and P3. However, P4â€™s low contribution suggests its profitability is limited, even during peak sales periods.

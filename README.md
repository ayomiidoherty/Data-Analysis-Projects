PROJECT OVERVIEW 


OBJECTIVE 


This project aims to evaluate the sales performance and revenue contributions of four products (P1, P2, P3, and P4) over multiple years, assess the potential impact of discontinuing a product, estimate sales performance for December 31st when their retail outlets are closed and forecast sales and revenue for the following year of 2023. 


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. Sales Trends: Sales for all four products exhibit a consistent trend across months, with P1 consistently leading in sales across all months.
Top-Performing Product: P1 has consistently outperformed the other products, generating the highest total sales across all years.
December 31st Estimate: Estimated sales for December 31st indicate P1 would generate the highest sales, followed by P3, P2, and P4.
Product Discontinuation Impact: Discontinuing any one product would likely result in a substantial revenue loss, with P4 being the least impactful to drop due to its lower sales contribution.
